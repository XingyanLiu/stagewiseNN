stagewiseNN - Building developmental tree from scRNA-seq
========================================================

**stagewiseNN** is a computational tool for constructing
developmental (lineage) tree from Multi-staged single-cell RNA-seq data.

It starts from building a single-cell graph by connecting each cell to its
k-nearest neighbors in the parent stage, followed by voting-based tree-construction
and adaptive cluster refinement.

The single-cell graph can be further visualized using graph embedding methods, e.g. UMAP, SPRING.

We have used it to build the developmental tree from Amphioxus embryonic cells, across
nine developmental stages ("B", "G3", "G4", "G5", "G6", "N0", "N1", "N3", "L0").
And seven major lineages were recognized.

Usage
-----

See :doc:`tutorial/tutorial_builder_based` for detailed guide.

.. code:: python3

   import swnn

   # ====== Inputs ======
   # data_matrix = ..
   # stage_labels = ..
   # group_labels = ..
   # stage_order = [f'stage_{i}' for i in range(5)]

   builder = swnn.Builder(stage_order=stage_order)
   # step1:
   # building (stage-wise) single-cell graph
   distmat, connect = builder.build_graph(
           X=data_matrix, stage_lbs=stage_labels,
       )
   # step2:
   # build developmental tree from single-cell graph
   edgedf, refined_group_lbs = builder.build_tree(group_labels, stage_labels,)
